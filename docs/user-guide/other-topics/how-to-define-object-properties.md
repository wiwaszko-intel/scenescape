# How to Define Object Properties

The Object Library allows you to configure various properties for object categories in Intel® SceneScape. This guide walks through the process of defining and customizing object properties.

## Working with the Object Library

1. Navigate to Intel® SceneScape homepage.
2. Click on the Object Library link in the top navigation bar.

### Add a New Object

1. Click on "New Object".
2. Input the object properties.
3. Click on "Add New Object".

### Update Existing Object

1. Click on the wrench/spanner icon in the Update column in the row of the object to be edited.
2. Edit the object properties.
3. Click on "Update Object" to save any changes.

## Basic Object Properties

### Size Configuration

- **Object size in x-axis**: Define the width of the object in meters
- **Object size in y-axis**: Define the length of the object in meters
- **Object size in z-axis**: Define the height of the object in meters

### Buffer Size Configuration

Buffers allow you to expand or shrink the bounding box around objects. This is particularly useful when:

- Working with pre-trained models that may not detect the entire object
- Adjusting detection boxes that are either too tight or too loose
- Creating custom visualization or collision zones

You can apply positive values to expand the bounding box or negative values to shrink it along any axis:

- **Object buffer size in x-axis**: Define the buffer width of the object in meters
- **Object buffer size in y-axis**: Define the buffer length of the object in meters
- **Object buffer size in z-axis**: Define the buffer height of the object in meters

### Tracking Behavior Settings

- **Tracking radius (meters)**: Set the maximum distance from the object center for matching new detections with the track.
- **Shift type**: Shift type is used to compute the bottom center of the object to estimate its position in world coordinates.
  - For most objects the default setting of "Type 1" will work well.
  - For wide and short objects, "Type 2" performs better.

## Additional Settings

- **Rotation from velocity**: When enabled, orientation of the object is inferred from the computed velocity.
- **Project to map**: When enabled, objects will be projected onto the map surface.

## 3D Model Configuration

By default, the shape of the object is a cuboid. Instead, the user can provide a 3D asset file (.glb) for 3D visualization.

1. Click on "New Object" or click on the wrench/spanner icon in the Update column in the row of the object to be edited..
2. Choose a .glb file with the file picker input.
3. Edit any of the asset property fields.
4. Click on "Add New Object" or "Update Object"

### Asset Properties

1. **Scale Adjustment**:
   - Use the scale value to resize the model uniformly along X, Y, and Z axes.

2. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - Rotate the 3D asset along X, Y, and Z axes to set the default orientation.

3. **Position Adjustment**:
   - Adjust the default position of the 3D asset wrt origin.

### Verify Results

1. Navigate to the 3D UI of a Scene.
2. Instead of the default cuboid, the uploaded 3D asset (.glb) will represent the tracked object.
